Feature: Machine Status Dashboard Verification
  As a customer user
  I want to view machine status counts on the dashboard
  So that I can know the number of machines in each state

  Background:
    Given the user launches the APMS Customer App
    And the user logs in with valid credentials
    And the user navigates to the "Overview" dashboard screen

  Scenario: Verify machine status counts on dashboard
    Then the user should see the count for "Running" machines as 6
    And the user should see the count for "Stopped" machines as 2
    And the user should see the count for "Waiting" machines as 2
    And the user should see the count for "Idle" machines as 0
    And the user should see the count for "Maintenance" machines as 0
    And the user should see the count for "Bypass" machines as 0
    And the user should see the count for "Product Setup" machines as 0
